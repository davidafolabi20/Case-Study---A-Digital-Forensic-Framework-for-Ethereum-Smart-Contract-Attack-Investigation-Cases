# Case Study - A Digital Forensic Framework for Ethereum Smart Contract Attack Investigation Cases

The case study used here is the Origin protocol exploit. It was used to validate the forensic framework developed as part of the original work.

We shall now follow the phases as originally described.

## Origin Protocol Exploit
### Background and Information Gathering
Origin Protocol is a blockchain project focused on building a decentralized e-commerce ecosystem. One of their key offerings was Origin USD (OUSD), a yield-bearing stablecoin. On November 17, 2020, the OUSD smart contract was exploited, resulting in approximately $7 million in losses.

This exploit was first reported on the 17th of November 2020 by the co-founder of Origin Protocol via his X account, see the figure below. The initial response to this was to halt the exploited contract and reassure concerned investors and users of consistent updates while the team investigated the exploit. The transaction hash of the first transaction involved in the exploit was included in the medium report attached to the post.
